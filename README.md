# EuroSAT Image Classification  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project explores **land use classification** using the [EuroSAT dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/7711810#.ZAm3k-zMKEA), which contains labeled satellite images across 10 land use and land cover categories (e.g., residential, industrial, agricultural).  

I implemented both **custom CNN architectures** and **transfer learning** with ResNet-34 in PyTorch, achieving strong performance on the dataset.

## üöÄ Key Features  
- **Transfer Learning (ResNet-34):** Achieved **98.6% accuracy** on the EuroSAT dataset  
- **Custom CNN:** Designed and trained a self-built CNN that reached **90%+ accuracy**  
- **Reproducible Pipeline:** End-to-end workflow for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and comparison of models  
- **Model Comparison:** Analyzed trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency for self-built vs. pre-trained models

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, Jupyter, Git  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** PyTorch, torchvision, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## üìä Results  
| Model            | Accuracy | Notes                                   |
|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| ResNet-34 (TL)   | **98.6%** | Transfer learning, fine-tuned on EuroSAT |
| Custom CNN       | 90%    | 4 convolutional layers, trained from scratch |

## üîç Next Steps  
- Experiment with **data augmentation** and **regularization techniques** to improve generalization  
- Explore lightweight CNN architectures (e.g., MobileNet, EfficientNet) for deployment  
- Investigate model explainability methods (e.g., Grad-CAM) to interpret predictions
